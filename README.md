## ðŸ“’ Overview

### Purpose
TDL is a C++ library that aims to provide a simple and easy-to-use interface for creating terminal-based applications. It is designed to be a lightweight and efficient solution for creating games, applications, and other software that can run in a terminal.

### Features

- **Window Management**: Create and manage terminal windows with ease.
- **Texture and Sprite Management**: Load and display images in the terminal.
- **Event Handling**: Handle keyboard / mouse input and other events.
- **Sound and Music**: Play sound effects and music in the terminal.
- **Text Rendering**: Render text in the terminal with different fonts and styles.
- **Works on graphical terminals and TTYS**: TDL works on both graphical terminals and TTYS.

## ðŸš€ Install

### Dependencies

To build and use TDL, you need the following dependencies:

- CMake
- GCC or Clang
- FreeType2
- libpng
- openAl
- libsndfile
- pkg-config
- libalsa
- libevdev

if you want to install dependancies on ubuntu you can use the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install cmake g++ libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev libopenal-dev libsndfile1-dev pkg-config libalsa-ocaml-dev libevdev-dev
```

On ArchLinux you can use the following command:
```
sudo pacman -S cmake gcc freetype2 libpng openal libsndfile pkg-config alsa-lib libevdev
```

### From AUR

To install from the AUR you can find the link [here](https://aur.archLinux.org/packages/tdl_terminal_directmedia_library).

### From this repository

To install and use TDL in your project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.

2. Create build folders and run the following command inside:
```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/ -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
cmake --build . --target install (you may need to run this as sudo)
```
The file should be correctly installed, and you can build your code using cmake and use the library.

## ðŸ¤– Examples

Here is a simple example of how to create a window and display an image using TDL:

You can find more examples in the [examples](examples) folder. If you want to build the examples, you can use the following commands:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DBUILD_DEMO=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF
cmake --build .
```
The examples will be built in the `demo folder at the root of the repository.
