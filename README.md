## ðŸ“’ Overview

### Purpose
TDL is a C++ library that aims to provide a simple and easy-to-use interface for creating terminal-based applications. It is designed to be a lightweight and efficient solution for creating games, applications, and other software that can run in a terminal.

### Features

- **Window Management**: Create and manage terminal windows with ease.
- **Texture and Sprite Management**: Load and display images in the terminal.
- **Event Handling**: Handle keyboard / mouse input and other events.
- **Sound and Music**: Play sound effects and music in the terminal.
- **Text Rendering**: Render text in the terminal with different fonts and styles.
- **Works on graphical terminals and TTYS**: TDL works on both graphical terminals and TTYS.
